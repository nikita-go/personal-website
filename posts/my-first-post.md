description: My first ever post (and some plans for this website)!
---

This is going to be pretty short since I don't have much to write. 

Despite being a newbie when it comes to web development (I only started back in August!), it's something I've come to surprisingly enjoy.

I'm thinking about adding a light/dark mode toggle button for this website since I know not everyone doesn't like dark themes. I'm also probably going to use this blog to post some math that I'll be doing for school. Something I'm thinking about is adding some of my solutions to CP contests that I take part in.

And of course, I'll be adding more [projects](https://nikitago.xyz/projects) over time as I learn more about web devlopment.
